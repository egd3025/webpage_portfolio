                            Being a restless sort, Moominpappa occasionally longs for adventure or for something new and exciting to happen, but he is an honourable Moomin who always tries to fulfil his duties.</div>

                            He is a villain, and proud of it! He is never one to let an opportunity for personal gain pass him by, and he always has a scheme or a racket on the go. 
                            Even though he is a known criminal, the Moomin family takes some pride in being on good terms with Stinky.</div>

                            They are pale grey-white in colour and look something like mushroom stalks with paws that extend directly from their trunks. 
                            They grow from little white seeds but only if the seeds are sown on Midsummer's Eve and can become charged up with electricity in lightning storms.</div>

                            She is a cold and solitary creature, who is feared by most residents of Moominvalley. 
                            The ground freezes beneath her and her icy presence leaves others thinking forlorn thoughts. 
                            She seeks warmth and light, but it always eludes her, so her lonely roaming continues.</div>

                            He is good-natured, loyal, excitable, and eager to join in any mission, but his taste for adventure is not often matched by his braveryâ€¦ 
                            He dreams of finding riches and is particularly taken with the idea of owning anything sparkly or valuable.</div>
